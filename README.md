# OpenRCT2 Launcher
An Alternative Open Source Launcher &amp; Updater for OpenRCT2

This is a new launcher for [OpenRCT2](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2). It's written in C++ using the Qt Framework. The main reason for creating this version is to add support for Mac OS X and Linux, as the other launcher only works properly on Windows.

Check out [PFCKrutonium's Launcher](https://github.com/PFCKrutonium/OpenRCT2Launcher), as it is more feature-complete at this moment.
